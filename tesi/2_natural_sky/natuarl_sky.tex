\chapter{The natural sky background}
Even when artificial sources are neglected, there are still several natural background sources. In this chapter each contribution will be described in detail. In the plot on the Figure \ref{fig:natural_sources} are reported, in logarithmic scale, the main background sources for a wide range of wavelengths, from UV to radio emission. In the next lines I will consider only sources relevant for optical observations.

\end{figure}

Photons produced by several background sources interact with dusts and aerosols in the Earth atmosphere leading to extinction and diffusion (scattering) phenomena. The total sky brightness can be quantitatively expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:I_tot}
I_\text{sky} = (I_A+I_{ZL}+I_{ISL}+I_{DGL}+I_{EBL})e^{-\tau}+I_\text{sca}
\end{equation}
where A stands for airglow, EZ is zodiacal light, ISL integrated galactic light, DGL diffuse galactic light and EBL extragalactic background light. $\tau$ is the extinction coefficients and $I_\text{sca}$ gathers all the scattering terms, i.e.\ light scattered from previous sources and from light pollution, from \cite{leinert19981997}.

\medskip
In this chapter I will analyze in detail all the terms of the equation \eqref{eq:I_tot}, their origin and the relevance and characteristic spectral features. At the end I will show and discuss some examples of sky background spectra taken from the literature.


\section{Extraterrestrial sources}
I will first consider sources of photons outside the earth atmosphere. Using space-based instrument it is possible to study these components without the interference of atmospheric emissions.

\subsection{Zodiacal light}
Zodiacal light consists on sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust particles \cite{leinert1975zodiacal}. From the Earth it looks like a white glow visible during the twilight and extending from the Sun in the zodiacal region.
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Angular distribution.} The figure \ref{fig:zodiacal_distribution}, adapted from \cite{frey1974photometry}, describes the angular distribution of the zodiacal light in ecliptic coordinates. Such light is maximum along the ecliptic and close to the Sun. A fainter local maximum is present in direction opposite to the Sun. It is known as \emph{gegenschein} and is produced by back-scattered solar light. Zodiacal light brightness varies from about \SI{e-6}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom} on the ecliptic at \ang{30} from the sun to about \SI{e-9}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom}. Gegenschein maximum brightness reaches about \SI{e-7}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom}. After the airglow (see \S XX), this is the second brightest background source in optical bands.

	\caption{Isophotal map ot the zodiacal light as \SI{7100}{\angstrom}. As a reference, according to \cite{leinert19981997}, $\SI{1}{S}_{10}/\square^\circ = \SI{9.21e-10}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom}$ at those wavelengths. From \cite{frey1974photometry}.\label{fig:zodiacal_distribution}}
\end{figure}

The contribution of zodiacal light to the optical background is maximum during the twilight, after sunset in spring or before sunrise in autumn, from the northern hemisphere.

\paragraph{Spectral energy distribution.} Being essentially reflected sunlight, the optical zodiacal light energy distribution has the same shape of the solar one.

\subsection{Galactic background}
In optical bands a significant contribution to the background level is provided by unresolved stars in the Galaxy. The contribution of such sources depends on the ability of resolve the brightest stars \cite{leinert19981997}, i.e.\ on the limiting magnitude of the instrument.

\paragraph{Angular distribution.} Unresolved stars background follows the morphological structure of the Milky Way. The signal is higher toward the galactic plane and the galactic center.  Its spectrum follows typical optical stellar spectra with the characteristic black-body emission. It is the third most relevant contribution to the optic continuum with an emission that spans from peak values of \SI{e-6}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom} in the most crowded areas to \SI{e-8}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom} toward the galactic poles.

\subsection{Diffuse galactic light}
Similar to the zodiacal light, it is the result of the scattering of stellar emission with interstellar dust particles. \cite{leinert19981997} estimate its contribution as between 20\% and 30\% of the total integrated light from the galaxy. This estimation is rather uncertain because of the faintness of the radiation and the contamination of direct stellar light. There are no comprehensive maps for the diffuse galactic light but it is very likely this emission to be concentrated along the galactic disk, analogously to the direct stellar component. Its spectral energy distribution is comparable with stellar spectra, since its nature of stellar reflected light.

\subsection{Extragalactic background}
A much smaller contribution is led by the extragalactic background, i.e.\ emission of faint and or unresolved galaxies. It is very difficult to quantify the resulting brightness and in many cases are available only the upper limits for extragalactic background. The main estimation difficulties are due to the faintness of the signal and with respect to the other sources. Typical values of intensity are of the order \SI{e-9}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom}. No reliable information about spatial distribution is available.

\section{Terrestrial sources}
Terrestrial sources are those capable of producing visible photons in the atmosphere.

\subsection{Airglow}
The airglow is the faint emission on the higher layers of the atmosphere, produced by the interaction between atoms and the particles from the solar wind or by the chemical interaction between atoms. High energy solar particles collide with the atmospheric atoms exciting their electrons to higher energy levels; when the electrons jump back to the initial states they release energy in form of photons, leading to the characteristic emission spectrum. Another possible emission channel is by chemical recombination: when atomic oxygen collide with nitrogen or hydrogen atoms a single molecule (NO or OH) is created and a photon is released. Atomic oxygen or nitrogen are produced by photodissociation of the respective molecules during the day by solar radiation.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Main components.} We can subdivide the airglow sources as a function of the height of the emitting layer. A first layer between 85 and \SI{100}{km} is provided by molecular oxygen, sodium (respectively Herzberg  bands and Fraunhofer D line) and OH transitions. Going higher, up to \SI{300}{km}, forbidden atomic oxygen lines are produced. The outermost layers of the atmosphere, above \SI{1000}{km}, are usually referred as geocorona; is this region faint but detectable hydrogen lines are produced.

Being produced by thin and homogeneous layers, the airglow emission is relatively uniformly distributed in the sky sphere, with an increase of brightness at high zenital distances due to the increase of geometric depth along the line of sight. Maximum brightness is achieved at about \ang{10} above the horizon after that the overall brightness is dimmed by atmospheric extinction. Brightest lines can produce a brightness up to \SI{e-5}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom}

\paragraph{Variations in airglow emission.} Airglow emission varies in time, both on short and long timescales, following the behavior of the atmosphere and the solar activity \cite{leinert19981997}. Emission is also related to the geomagnetic latitude: is maximal in the sub-polar region, at a latitude of about $\ang{60}-\ang{80}$ after which it significantly drop. In the polar region airglow emissions are substituted with auroral emission. In the low latitude regions emissions are generally low with a slight increase toward the equator \cite{eather1969latitudinal}.

\subsection{Aurorae}
Aurorae are bright light bands observable at polar latitudes. They are produced by the excitation of atoms in the high layers of the atmosphere by the solar wind. At high latitudes interplanetary high energy charged particles can penetrate the magnetosphere ad reach the atmosphere where they collide and excite atmospheric elements. Excitation energy is then released in form of a photon, responsible for the observed radiation. Auroral spectrum is constituted by emission lines. Colors ranges from green and orange (typical of oxygen transitions) to blue or purple (trace of nitrogen emission), see figure \ref{fig:aurora}.
\begin{figure}

	\caption{Aurora borealis in the northern Finland. Credits: \href{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aurora_Borealis_-_polar_lights_3.jpg}{Martincco}.\label{fig:aurora}}
\end{figure}

The occurrence and intensity of this phenomenon is strictly regulated by the solar activity, and an increase of auroral emission can be observed during solar storms or period of high activity. The phenomenon is observable only in polar regions, namely above \ang{80} of latitude (see \cite{eather1969latitudinal}) and for this reason it has a limited impact on the total optical sky background only in that geographic area. Nevertheless in case of intense solar activity like solar storms, aurorae can be observed at lower latitudes. Historical sources even report the sporadic observation of aurorae up to temperate latitudes.


\section{Atmospheric scattering}
Atmospheric scattering refers to the interaction of light with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Unlike reflection or refraction, when a light beam get scattered its photons are deflected in random directions. Note scattering is somehow the complementary of extinction: when a light beam is dimmed due to extinction it means that part of its photons has been deflected (thus scattered) away from the beam direction. Extinction occurs when looking directly at a light source, while scattering is the diffuse radiation around the source.

\subsection{Scattering mechanisms}
There are two main scattering mechanism, depending on the size of the particle with respect to the wavelength of the incident radiation: Mie and Rayleigh scattering.

\paragraph{Rayleigh scattering.} This is due to the interaction of light with particles smaller that the wavelength: if the particle is small enough the phase difference of the beam along the particle is negligible and the it ``sees'' in each moment an homogeneous electromagnetic field. The particle will be forced by the beam to emit as an oscillating dipole, in phase with the beam and with the same wavelength, but in a random direction. From the dipole theory, when a light beam of intensity $I_0$ travels trough a medium, meeting $N$ particles of polarizability $\alpha$, the scattered intensity of the beam is
\begin{equation}
	I = I_0 \frac{8\pi^4 N\alpha}{R^2} \frac{1+\cos^2\varphi}{\lambda^4}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation and $\varphi$ the angle between the beam and the observing direction. Note that it steadily decreases at increasing wavelengths ($\propto\lambda^{-4}$), i.e.\ Rayleigh scattering is stronger in the blue than in the red bands. Concerning the angular distribution of scattered light, the intensity is maximum both along the original beam direction (\emph{forward scattering}) as well as in the opposite direction, back to the source (\emph{back scattering}). Minima are located at \ang{90} from the maxima.

In the optical regime, Rayleigh scattering is produced by the air molecules themselves. This form of scattering is responsible for the blue sky in daytime and for twilight. It is also the main responsible for atmospheric extinction, in particular at shorter wavelengths.

\paragraph{Mie scattering.} Mie scattering occurs when light meets particles of size comparable or larger than the characteristic wavelength. In this case different parts of the particle experience different intensities of the electromagnetic field; each portion of the particle will emit as a single dipole, locally in phase with the beam, and the total emission will be the result of the interference pattern between all the portion of the particle. In this case only the wavelength of the original beam is preserved, while phase is distorted and direction is random. The numerical expression of Mie scattering is rather complex and involves the solution of Maxwell equation; several numerical or empirical relation are available in the literature. For our purposes it is relevant to say that the intensity of Mie scattering is proportional to $\propto\lambda^{-0.8}$. Moreover, most of the light is scattered along or close to the beam direction, i.e.\ the forward component is dominant (the larger the particle, the more relevant the forward component).

In the atmosphere Mie scattering is produced by solid particles suspended in the air (\emph{aerosols}), such as dust grains, smoke or water drops. In the figure \ref{fig:scattering_sources}, from \cite{tug1977vertical}, are reported the extinction coefficients, a proxy the total scattered light, for Rayleigh and Mie scattering (the latter labelled as ``aerosols''). It is clear that Mie scattering is negligible with respect to Rayleigh one, in particular at shorter wavelengths. This is true only in clear sky conditions, with an atmosphere locally without fog, smoke or other pollutants, that may significantly rise the impact of Mie scattering.

	\caption{Extinction coefficients for Rayleigh and aerosol (Mie) scattering. The former component dominates over the latter at all the wavelengths, in particular for shorter ones. From \cite{tug1977vertical}.\label{fig:scattering_sources}}
\end{figure}

Note that to the Ozone extinction component in the figure \ref{fig:scattering_sources} does not correspond any scattered component since it is produced by molecular absorption. In this case the radiation absorbed, instead of being re-emitted, is used to increase the kinetic energy of each ozone molecule, heating the ozone layer. This process is responsible for the temperature gradient inversion in the stratosphere.

\subsection{Effects on the sky brightness}
Every light source is responsible for a certain amount of light scattering. Depending on the site and the observation time, the effects of scattering on the total sky brightness can vary significantly.

\paragraph{Dark clear sites.} In a dark site most of the scattered light is produced by airglow, zodiacal light and the galactic background, i.e.\ the brightest ``direct'' light sources. According to \cite{leinert19981997} scattered light from the natural sources accounts for a brightness of the order of \num{e-8} to \SI{e-7}{erg\per\second \per\centi\metre\squared \per\steradian\per\angstrom}.

\paragraph{Light polluted sites.} Atmospheric light scattering is the main mechanism responsible for light pollution when far from the light source. Due to Earth curvature, geographic features and atmospheric extinction the direct light contribute to pollution only when very close to the light source. As reported in the chapter XX, brightness of scattered artificial light from a city varies with the population and the distance.

\paragraph{Scattered sunlight and moonlight.} As said before Rayleigh scattering is responsible for the twilight: even if the Sun is below the horizon some residual scattered light still brightens the sky. Conventionally astronomical twilight ends when the sun is \ang{18} below the horizon and other light sources, such as zodiacal light, becomes more relevant.

A similar effect is provided by scattered moonlight. Such light brightness depends on the lunar phase and on the distance between the Moon and the observing position in the sky. According to \cite{krisciunas1991model} and similar sources, in optical bands scattered moonlight can lead to an increase of the sky brightness of the order of \SI{5}{mag\per {arcsec}\squared}.
