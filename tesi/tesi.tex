	Modern sky brightness monitoring techniques aim to precisely measure the total amount of radiation from the observing site but very little can be said about the various sources responsible for such radiation.
	In this work I will use spectroscopic data to identify the various sources in the sky of the Asiago Observatory, Italy, and study their temporal evolution.

\section{Light pollution}
Light pollution (LP) is the alteration of the natural light level due to artificial sources. The resulting increase of the sky brightness has many proven negative effects.

\paragraph{Effects on the human health.} Light exposure in nigh time decrease the natural production melatonin. The effect is proportional to the frequency of light, with bluer radiation producing a stronger decrease of melatonin production.
	
Melatonin is an important hormone that regulates many biological mechanism. It is capable of prevent some forms of cancer and is responsible of the sleep regulation. A melatonin deficiency has been proven to be correlated with higher chances of developing breast and prostate cancers and a decrease of sleep time and quality, which typically lead to further health disorders.
	
Melatonin decrease is proportional both to light intensity and frequency. A greater effect is given by brighter and bluer sources. In this context the spreading of LED lights, with their strong emissions in the blue side of visible spectrum, is considered a concern by many health associations.

\paragraph{Effects on the environment.} LP affects other living beings as well as humans. Animals exposed to abnormal level of light at night change their behaviour and habits. Note this form of pollution is probably the most widespread but yet one of the least acknowledged.

\paragraph{Economical effects.} When looking at a artificially bright sky one should consider that such photons that brighten the sky are no longer being used for the purpose they were made for, i.e.\ lighten streets, houses, commercial areas and so on. The energy, and thus the cost, to produce such photons is wasted. 

Unluckily in the last years efficient light sources like LEDs allowed to produce powerful lighting systems at low cost making the economical argument less relevant. Since light is cheaper, it is less critical weather part of it is lost toward the sky.

\paragraph{Cultural effects.} All the cultures around the world developed myths and legends involving the heavens; night sky inspired artists and philosophers in western cultures for centuries and in general the observation of a starry sky always belonged to the human experiences. Today due to LP FabbriXX estimates that at least the XX\% of the world population lives in areas where milky way is not even visible and only a handful of bright stars can stand out of the polluted sky. In terms of traditions and human experience this is a great loss, but yet difficult, or impossible, to quantify.

\paragraph{Scientific effects.} Of course the increase of sky brightness made astronomical observations more difficult. Observation sites moved from the town centres in the XIX century to the rural areas due to the introduction of the first lighting. With the growing urbanization, many of these sites ended up to by at the limb of the expanding urban areas, heavily limiting the possibility of relevant scientific activities. Nowadays it is likely that in a country no totally dark sites are available, forcing astronomers to build new instruments in very remote areas in poorly populated areas of the world.

A typical example of the effects in the changing of the sky condition is the Asiago observatory. It was built in 1942 in a poorly populated highland, which also offered an adequate shielding from the light of the yet small rural centres in the nearby pianura veneta. When built, the observatory also hosted the largest reflecting telescope in the Europe (Gaileo telescope, 122\,m of diameter).
With the economic boom in the 50s, industrial and manufacturing activities replaced agriculture in the Veneto flatland. Urban areas significantly expanded making Veneto region one of the most light polluted sites in the whole Europe. At the same time the Asiago highland become one of the most appreciated touristic destination in the surrounding area. The quality of the sky rapidly worsened also with respect to other nearby areas less touched by human activities. In such new condition the Asiago Observatory lost its central role in research activities tough preserving its nature of scientific pole.

\section{Aim of the work}
For all the issues above measuring and monitoring the LP is of crucial important.
