# Master thesis Marco Codato

## Roadmap

### Done
- The script save the bkg masked spectrum in a mew file, mantaining the orginal header too.
- Write a script that opens a FITS file, automatically detects and remove astornomical sources.

### To be done soon
- It would be nice to include more information in the header of the new file, e.g. when the script was runt and which rows were removed
- Develope a more quantitative way to select the sources (?)
